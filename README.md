# Census-2011-Analysis
Analysis of Indian Census Data

The purpose of this analysis :

1)To understand the census data -  decadal growth of population , distribution of population by gender, the employement status across the country and the distribution of religions in India.

2)Also to analyse the data about few controversial articles that were released in Aug 2015 - about the distribution of 
muslims Vs Hindus in India.

The primary issue was that some analysts point out that the muslim population(compared to Hindu population)this decade 
as opposed to the last decade was high.Few others point out that the growth of muslim population every decade is 
at an average rate of 25%.But this decade the rate of growth was much lesser.

To take a look at the insights - the article is published on Jigsaw Academy blog page.
